# Centroid Tech Support Tools
This is a suite of tools to help aid in providing tech support for Centroid.<br><br>
__v1.3 Release 1-25-26__<br>
Directory Manager replaced the previous directory renamer.<br>
Inspired by AvidCNC's profile manager this program can "activate" and "deactivate" CNC12 installations.<br>
Shown in a spreadsheet style interface the user can see at a glance which installations they have available, if they're "active," what type of installation it is, when it was last changed, and the first line of the machine_notes.txt file.<br>
Using a right click context menu the user can refresh the list, activate or deactivate the selected installation, open the directory of the selected installation in a file explorer, open machine_notes.txt of the selected installation, launch the installs executable, or deactivate all active installations all at once.<br>
The list by default is first sorted by Active and second by Machine type but can be resorted at will by the user by clicking the column headers.
